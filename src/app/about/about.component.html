<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>The AJSA Community was created as a way to organize and bring together both fans of Joe and those who are looking for a community where they can play and talk about games. We want this community to be a friendly and welcoming place for anyone who wants to play and talk about games, ideally in a positive and/or constructive way. It is not a problem if you do not watch Joe's content, we will still be happy to have you as a member. Currently, the AJSA consists of this website, the AJSA Discord, Youtube channel, Twitter, Twitch channel, official clans and groups in a variety of PC games, and our active PS4 and Xbox One communities.</p>
